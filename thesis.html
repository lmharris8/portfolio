            <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
            
            <p>Research indicates that social development is important for the health of adolescents, suggesting a need for additional interior design methods in educational facility planning that encourage student social engagement. The purpose of this study is to determine the degree to which middle school educators perceive the built environment of secondary educational facilities as influencing the social development of adolescents. A qualitative research study utilizing a case study methodology was established to delve into educator perceptions regarding the correlation between student social engagement and educational facility design. There were nine educators from seven educational facilities in the research sample. All educators taught seventh through ninth grade near Birmingham, Alabama. Data was collected through a combination of interviews and site visits. The research was analyzed using a general inductive approach, and three significant findings emerged. First, all the participants indicated that the built environment of an educational facility is important to student social development. Second, the participants identified five elements and principles of design that influence student social development: space and ceiling heights, lighting and windows, color and visual complexity, furniture, and acoustics. Third, the participants identified six areas of an educational facility that impact social development: classrooms, outdoor spaces, hallways and locker areas, libraries and theaters, gymnasiums, and auxiliary meeting spaces. It is intended that these findings will lead to more effective educational design practices that benefit adolescent students and the interior design community.</p>

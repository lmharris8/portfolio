                    <p>Students were assigned a small-scale set of construction drawings for their final project. The set included a partition plan, furniture plan, reflected ceiling plan, power and communications plan, finish plan, interior elevations, and interior sections.</p>

                    <p>The goal of this project was to incorporate all the AutoCAD techniques learned throughout the class and apply them to a realistic interior design application. Since this class is a pre-requisite to the upper-level studio classes, design principles were not evaluated in these construction documents. However, students were assessed on their ability to incorporate their AutoCAD skills and interior design standards into a construction document set using AutoCAD.</p>
                    
                    <p>Grading criteria included layers and standards, blocks, text heights, dimensions, hatches, symbols, legend creation, proper markers, organization, titleblocks, and presentation.</p>
                    
                    <p>An example student final project is included on the next 6 pages. The final project was worth 250 points.</p>
                    
                    <p>The final grades of the class were as follows:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Student A: 92%</li>

                            <li>Student C: 97%</li>
                            <li>Student D: 94%</li>

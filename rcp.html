                    <p>The goal of this project was two-fold: 1) to introduce students to layers and layer management, and 2) to introduce students to designing reflected ceiling plans.</p>

                    <p>Students were required to appropriately assign all building elements to layers established by the interior design department. Naming conventions, lineweights, colors, and line types were all assessed.</p>
                            
                    <p>To demonstrate their knowledge of layers and layer management, students were required to create a reflected ceiling plan. Because the students had not yet completed their studio courses, the design of the RCP was not graded. However, they were required to incorporate certain elements such as 2 types of light fixtures, both ceiling grid and gyp board ceilings, HVAC and light fixtures, and switching. A lighting legend was also included with the assignment.</p>
                            
                    <p>This project was worth 50 points, and an example of a student submission is shown to the right.</p>

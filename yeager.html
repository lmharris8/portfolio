                        <p>
                            The Yeager family engaged Laura Harris to lead the renovation of their 1920s bungalow
                            located in Birmingham's Crestwood neighborhood. After more than a decade in the home, the
                            family of four required a comprehensive interior reconfiguration to improve functionality
                            and flow, particularly expanding the single-bathroom layout, while preserving the
                            architectural character and charm of the historic residence.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Laura was responsible for producing the construction documents and managing the project
                            through construction administration over a two-year timeline. The scope included a full
                            interior renovation and the demolition of a poorly constructed rear sunroom, which was
                            replaced with a new addition extending three feet beyond the existing footprint. All design
                            decisions were carefully evaluated against local zoning, setback requirements, and building
                            codes to ensure compliance while maximizing usable space. Select components of the permit
                            set, including the basement stair modifications, were developed in collaboration with a
                            licensed architect to ensure compliance with local building codes.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The renovation introduced two additional bathrooms, improved storage through enlarged
                            closets, and eliminated impractical circulation patterns created by redundant doorways.
                            Laura brought the existing basement stair into code compliance to create a finished
                            lower-level living space with integrated guest accommodations. The former sunroom was
                            reconfigured into a primary bathroom, walk-in closet, and multifunctional laundry space.
                            Throughout the project, budget-conscious strategies guided decision-making, including the
                            selective reuse of existing doors, windows, and plumbing locations wherever feasible.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The completed renovation successfully modernized the home's spatial organization while
                            maintaining its original bungalow character. The project was featured in Southern Living,
                            highlighting its thoughtful balance of preservation, charm, and functionality.

                    <p>
                        Teaching represents the most meaningful intersection of my professional practice and commitment
                        to interior design knowledge. The act of educating another person is a privilege that requires
                        intentional preparation, thoughtful engagement, and a responsibility to foster both intellectual
                        and professional growth. I am particularly motivated by moments when students gain clarity and
                        confidence as they connect conceptual ideas to practical application. This motivation informs my
                        teaching approach, which emphasizes scaffolded learning, experiential engagement, and the
                        intentional integration of theory with professional practice.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I develop students through a scaffolded learning process that begins with foundational design
                        principles and progresses toward advanced application in pragmatic, real-world scenarios. My
                        goal is to help students understand how abstract concepts are realized in the built environment
                        and how design decisions directly affect the people who inhabit these spaces. Students are
                        encouraged not only to master form and function, but also to recognize how thoughtful design can
                        positively influence human interaction, well-being, and experience. Complex ideas are
                        intentionally broken into manageable components that build upon one another throughout the
                        curriculum and are reinforced through site visits, precedent studies, cultural context, and
                        reflection on lived experience.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I believe interior design education must be approached holistically. While students must develop
                        a strong foundation in the elements and principles of design, they should also be guided in
                        cultivating professional competencies such as time management, effective client communication,
                        pragmatic problem-solving, and working within established budgets. These skills are reinforced
                        through iterative feedback, design critiques, and evaluation methods that emphasize growth,
                        accountability, and clarity of communication. I also encourage students to engage early with
                        local chapters of national design organizations to develop professional responsibility, ethical
                        awareness, and a commitment to lifelong learning beyond the classroom.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As an educator, I view teaching as both a responsibility and a form of service, grounded in a
                        deep sense of joy and purpose. I am committed to fostering a supportive learning environment
                        where students feel encouraged to ask questions, explore ideas, and develop confidence in their
                        abilities. Through mentorship, clear expectations, and an emphasis on integrity and
                        professionalism, I aim to prepare students not only for successful careers in interior design,
                        but also for thoughtful engagement with the communities and environments they will ultimately
                        serve.
                    </p>

            <h2>TEACHING PHILOSOPHY</h2>
            
            <p>There are few experiences in life that I find as fulfilling as teaching. Instructing students combines my love for the interior design industry with my desire to guide students into translating design from abstract to concrete. I believe this passion is contagious, and an instructor who demonstrates this passion and energy in the classroom will consequently motivate students.</p>

            <p>I strive to develop students from the beginning stages of learning the foundational design principles to the more advanced skills of applying these principles in pragmatic and realistic scenarios. My goal is to help students understand how these abstract concepts become reality in the built environment and how these concepts impact the occupants who live and work in these environments. I want to help students not only master form and function but to positively influence human interactions within space. This is achieved through dividing large design concepts into smaller blocks that then build on each other as the student progresses through the program. It is also important that these concepts be actualized through site visits, cultural connections, and past experiences.</p>

            <p>I believe it is important for an educator to approach interior design education holistically. It is necessary for students to have a foundation of the fundamentals formed through early art and design classes that introduce them to the elements and principles of design. However, I also believe an educator must guide a student in learning time management, proper interactions with clients, ways to approach design pragmatically, and how to set a budget and operate within that budget. I know these skills will help students immensely as they begin their careers. In addition, I encourage students to connect with the local chapters of national design organizations as soon as possible. This will help them define professional standards and continue the learning process when they are outside the structure of organized education.</p>
